   abstract = {As an alternative to the long history of interpreting artificial intelligence (AI) as the attempt to rationalize and mechanize human ingenuity, thereby transcending nature and its perceived limits, this article proposes an interpretation of the conceptual foundations of environmental intelligence (EI) as the effort to develop digital technology and data-intensive algorithmic systems to sustain and enhance life on this planet. Thus articulated, EI provides a framework to challenge and redefine the philosophical premises of AI in ways that can explicitly spur the responsible and sustainable development of computational technologies toward public interest goals.},

   abstract = {Meta-research, also known as “research on research” is a field of study that investigates the methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives along the research continuum. Meta-research literacy is imperative to ensure high quality, transparent and reproducible primary data or meta-research products. In this commentary, we propose that early career researchers should be trained in meta-research as a foundation to develop a deeper understanding of the research process and ability to appraise the research literature and design high-quality original studies, irrespective of their chosen field of study. We discuss the importance of meta-research and open science from the perspective of an early career trainee, highlighting essential areas for growth and obstacles one may encounter.},

@article{Dudda2025,
   abstract = {Various open science practices have been proposed to improve the reproducibility and replicability of scientific research, but not for all practices, there may be evidence they are indeed effective. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of the literature on interventions to improve reproducibility. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus and Eric, on 18 August 2023. Any study empirically evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving the reproducibility or replicability of scientific methods and findings was included. We summarized the retrieved evidence narratively and in evidence gap maps. Of the 105 distinct studies we included, 15 directly measured the effect of an intervention on reproducibility or replicability, while the remainder addressed a proxy outcome that might be expected to increase reproducibility or replicability, such as data sharing, methods transparency or pre-registration. Thirty studies were non-comparative and 27 were comparative but cross-sectional observational designs, precluding any causal inference. Despite studies investigating a range of interventions and addressing various outcomes, our findings indicate that in general the evidence base for which various interventions to improve reproducibility of research remains remarkably limited in many respects.},

   abstract = {The scholarly publishing system is adapting to many changes, including open access and open data mandates, artificial intelligence, and other new technologies. Members of the research and publishing communities are working to establish a more equitable, fair, and rigorous system that serves researchers' evolving needs. Early career researchers (ECRs) are drivers of change, and publishers may wonder why and how they should involve ECRs in shaping the future of scholarly publishing. We held a virtual unconference to explore this issue with publishers and ECRs who were working to improve publishing. Some participants sought to improve peer reviewer or editor performance, whereas others sought to improve the publishing system itself through iterative or transformative change. Strategies for collaborating with ECRs to shape the future of scholarly publishing included peer review programmes, editorial programmes, ECR-led journals, ECR boards and committee representatives, and other ECR-initiated activities. ECRs particularly wanted to see three things improved: (1) Sharing research outputs other than publications, (2) addressing technological limitations to create systems that meet the research community's needs and facilitate knowledge advancement, and (3) fostering diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. We offer tips for publishers on how to collaborate with ECRs to enhance scholarly publishing, appeal to and learn from younger researchers, and better meet researchers' needs.},
